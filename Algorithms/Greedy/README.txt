How to run a code:
	
	Running in local is acceptable. I am using python 3.7. That works. It can be run by OSU sever as well.
	How to run in OSU sever?
	1. Download MobaXterm
	2. Use ssh to connect OSU sever. The address is flip.engr.oregonstate.edu
	3. login your OSU account
	4. upload all files in the zip file.
	5. check whether it is running in the same folder. If not, use cd command to move in the folder.
	6. type python "name of the file".py and it can be run directly. For example: python act.py
